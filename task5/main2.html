        <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee ( 25 December 1924 â€“ 16 August 2018) was an Indian politician who served three terms as the 10th Prime Minister of India, 
            first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. 
            Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior leader of the BJP. He was a member of the RSS, a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. 
            He was the first Indian prime minister not of the INC to serve a full term in office. He was also a renowned poet and a writer.

            He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the Lok Sabha, the lower house, 
            and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the MP (LS) for Lucknow, retiring from active politics in 2009 due 
            to health concerns. He was among the founding members of the BJS, of which he was president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged 
            with several other parties to form the JP, which won the 1977 general election. In March 1977, Vajpayee became the Minister of 
            External Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after. 
            Former members of the BJS formed the BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee its first president.

            During his tenure as prime minister, India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. 
            Vajpayee sought to improve diplomatic relations with Pakistan, travelling to Lahore by bus to meet with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. 
            After the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, he sought to restore relations through engagement with President Pervez Musharraf,
            inviting him to India for a summit at Agra. Vajpayee's government introduced many domestic economic and infrastructural reforms, 
            including encouraging the private sector and foreign investments, reducing governmental waste, encouraging research and development 
            and privatisation of some government owned corporations.[2] Among Vajpayee's projects were the National Highways Development Project, 
            Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana[3][4] and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan campaign, aimed at improving the quality of education in primary 
            and secondary schools.
            <br>
            Vajpayee is considered one of the most respected prime ministers of India, receiving praise from the opposition as well. 
            He scores high on India's top ranked prime ministers and is regarded as one of the best prime ministers in Indian history.
            The administration of Narendra Modi declared in 2014 that Vajpayee's birthday, 25 December, would be marked as Good Governance Day. 
            In 2015, he was conferred India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, by the president of India, Pranab Mukherjee. 
            He died in 2018 of age-related illness.
